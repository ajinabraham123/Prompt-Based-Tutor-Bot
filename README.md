## **4. Core Bot Features**

### **4.1 Subject Q&A Module**

- **Function**: Respond to Python coding questions with detailed explanations and code examples.
- **Details**:
  - Structured answers ranging from basic to advanced concepts.
  - Includes sample Python code snippets.

#### **Example**
- **Prompt**:
How do I find the maximum subarray sum in Python?

python
- **Bot Response**:
# Solution using Kadane's Algorithm:
def max_subarray_sum(nums):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    current_sum = 0
    for num in nums:
        current_sum = max(num, current_sum + num)
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    return max_sum

# Example usage:
nums = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]
print(max_subarray_sum(nums))  # Output: 6
4.2 Step-by-Step Problem Solving with Hints
Function: Guide users through coding problems step-by-step with hints.
Details:
Breaks problems into smaller steps for clarity.
Provides hints to guide the user when stuck.
Example
Prompt:
css
Copy code
Write a Python function to check if a number is a palindrome.
Bot Response:
python
Copy code
# Step 1: Understand what a palindrome is.
# Step 2: Convert the number to a string for easy reversal.
# Step 3: Check if the reversed string matches the original.

# Code:
def is_palindrome(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    return str_n == str_n[::-1]
